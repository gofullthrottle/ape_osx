# This isn't a script because I'm not sure how to scriptify my plugins,

Adblock Plus (or Edge) - good ad-blocker
JSONView  - I'm iffy on this, but it makes json api output easy to read,
            with expand / hide abilities
            I'm only iffy because it can be slow on big outputs, other than
            that it's great
Chrome History Fuzzy Search - this is awesome. Cmd-K.
Tab Ahead - a fuzzy finder for open tabs. Not as cool as the history
            fuzzy search, but still handy. Alt-T.
